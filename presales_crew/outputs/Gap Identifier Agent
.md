gaps_and_questions:
  - gap: Details on the specific APIs and data transfer mechanisms required for the BambooHR integration are not provided.
    follow_up_question: Can you provide the specific API documentation or endpoints from BambooHR that need to be integrated with the new system?
  - gap: Metrics for assessing "timely and meaningful feedback" are not clearly defined.
    follow_up_question: What are the specific metrics or indicators you currently use or propose to use to measure the timeliness and meaningfulness of feedback?
  - gap: Lack of clarity on the employee survey measures and how they will be used to enhance user experience.
    follow_up_question: Could you specify what employee survey measures will be used to evaluate the user experience and satisfaction with the new system?
  - gap: Details about the vendor selection criteria and process are missing.
    follow_up_question: What are the criteria and process you will use for selecting a vendor for this software solution?
  - gap: Specific performance metrics beyond general categories are not detailed.
    follow_up_question: Can you list the specific performance metrics you aim to improve, and how will these be measured post-implementation?
  - gap: Assumption of existing technical infrastructure adequacy without details.
    follow_up_question: Can you confirm or specify any necessary updates or expansions to your current technical infrastructure to support this new system?
  - gap: The approach to mitigate risks related to insufficient user adoption or resistance is not discussed.
    follow_up_question: What strategies do you plan to implement to ensure high user adoption rates and mitigate resistance to the new system?
  - gap: The development timeline lacks detail on potential phases or milestones within the 6 to 12 month post-implementation period.
    follow_up_question: Can you outline the major milestones or phases you expect during the 6 to 12-month post-implementation period?
  - gap: Not enough information on the extent of the system's AI capabilities, such as specifics of AI-powered feedback analysis.
    follow_up_question: Could you elaborate on the desired capabilities and applications of AI within this system, specifically regarding feedback analysis?
  - gap: Compatibility with existing HR systems is presumed but not verified aside from BambooHR.
    follow_up_question: Are there other HR systems apart from BambooHR that the new software will need to integrate with, and have these been confirmed as compatible?
